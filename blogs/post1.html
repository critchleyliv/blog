  <div class="medium-7 column">
    
    <p>There are many factors to take into consideration when deciding whether or not to commit yourself to dreadlocks. The first, most important thing you need to know about starting dreads is that they take a lot of time and patience to become developed. When they are new, they are ugly and messy and annoying and you must be prepared for that. The way your hair produces oil will change based upon the less frequent washing of your hair. Once your hair is in the dreads, the hairs that aren’t completely looped into the loc will begin to fall out and create these really irritating loops on the outside of the loc.</p> 

<p>Secondly, you need to think about what you want your locs to look like when they’re completely mature. Do you want to have many thin locs or fewer thick locs? This pertains directly to the size of the section you’re staring the dread from. The sections I used to start my dreads are about 1’ x  1’ but some are closer to 1.5’ x 1.5’; and I have roughly thirty locs that are on the thicker side. Some people say thick and think locs are the difference between femininity and masculinity but I have seen people in either gender role that have either types of thickness. Below I’ll attach a guide for sectioning dreads and an estimate of how many dreadlocks the sections will yield. </p>

<p>The third thing you should consider when deciding to dread your hair is how permeant will your dreads be? Do you intend on keeping them for six months or six years? For all the work and effort, you would put into your dreads in the first six months, it would be kinda silly for you to keep them for under a year. </p>
